What is Obesity?

Having a body weight that is higher than what is considered healthy for a given height is described as overweight or obesity. There are many methods of measuring this, some of which are expensive and time consuming. BMI, which is inexpensive and easy to calculate, is typically used as a proxy. Health officials recommend that individual health assessments should consider other factors as well. Research has demonstrated that a high BMI is strongly correlated with negative health consequences, although the association between BMI does vary among ethnic groups.

BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by their height in meters squared. For measurements in pounds and inches, BMI is calculated using the following formula:
BMI Formula
Defining Obesity Among Children and Teens
Because kids are still growing, obesity is measured differently among children than adults. Instead of a simple BMI measurement, a child’s BMI is compared to others of the same age and sex.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), child obesity is defined as a BMI that is at or above the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex. Overweight is defined as a BMI that is at or above the 85th percentile and below the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex.
Why is BMI age- and sex-specific for children and teens?

A child’s weight status is determined using an age- and sex-specific percentile for BMI, which is different from BMI categories used for adults. Because children’s body fat levels change over the course of childhood and vary between boys and girls, their BMI levels are expressed relative to other children of the same age and sex.

Data Introduction

Data has a large potential to positively impact us now more than ever, which is why I chose to analyze a dataset that estimated obesity levels based on the eating habits and physical condition of people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. I was interested in the relationship between body fat levels and lifestyle habits, as the findings can be applicable to the health and wellbeing of many, if not most, of us. It is especially relevant because BMI has been on the news a lot recently due to the fact that those with a high BMI are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine earlier, as obese individuals are three times more likely to be hospitalized from the virus. I used a dataset from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository, which included the data of 2111 individuals ages 14 to 61.

The dataset had 17 attributes, many of which have acronyms for ease of coding, so I will give briefly describe all of the attributes:

    Gender: female or male
    Age: numeric
    Height: numeric, in meters
    Weight: numeric, in kilograms
    family_history (family history of obesity): yes or no
    FCHCF (frequent consumption of high caloric food): yes or no
    FCV (frequency of consumption of vegetables: 1, 2, or 3; 1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = always
    NMM (number of main meals): 1, 2, 3 or 4
    CFBM (consumption of food between meals): 1, 2, 3, or 4; 1=no, 2=sometimes, 3=frequently, 4=always
    Smoke: yes or no
    CW (consumption of water): 1, 2, or 3; 1 = less than a liter, 2 = 1–2 liters, 3 = more than 2 liters
    CCM (calorie consumption monitoring): yes or no
    PAF (physical activity frequency per week): 0, 1, 2, or 3; 0 = none, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2= 2 to 4 days, 3 = 4 to 5 days
    TUT (time using technology devices a day): 0, 1, or 2; 0 = 0–2 hours, 1 = 3–5 hours, 2 = more than 5 hours
    CA (consumption of alcohol): 1, 2, 3, or 4; 1= never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = frequently, 4 = always
    Transportation: automobile, motorbike, bike, public transportation, or walking
    Obesity**: insufficient weight, normal weight, level I overweight, level II overweight, type I obesity, type 2 obesity, type 3 obesity; these categories are listed from lowest to highest body fat
